the site = either 
    queue.dcism.org
    hermes.dcism.org
    home.dcism.org

both = windows and linux

when using data
    linux (windows untested and unecessary) can access the site from browser
    linux (windows untested and unecessary) can scrape with python
    
when using home network
    only windows can access the site from browser

irrelevant setting
    tracert(Windows) and tracerout(Linux) cannot reach the site
        all gets stopped at 10.2.0.143
    repplit and proxies cannot reach the site
    both cannot ping the site

current guess:
    not a DNS issue
    firewall blocking all non-browser calls
    firewall blocking all linux systems from isp
